# Collaborative-Real-Time-Development-Environment
This project aims to build a Collaborative Real-Time Code Editor where multiple users can work on the same code together from different locations. It will allow users to type, edit, and view code updates instantly, just like working on a shared document. The editor will include helpful features like live chat for communication, user roles to manage who can edit or view, and an auto-save or history feature to track changes. This tool will be useful for students, teachers, developers, and teams who want to learn, teach, or build projects together in real time. In the future, we plan to add visual features like graphical flow diagrams or voice support for better collaboration.
